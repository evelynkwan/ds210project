# ds210project
welcome to my ds210 final project

the  goal of this project is to construct a graph-based model of the Pokemon dataset where each Pokemon is a node, and edges connect Pokemon that are similar in base stats. I will then use graph clustering techniques to identify natural groupings of Pokemon and explore what these clusters represent in terms of role. 

The question I want to answer is: *Can we use stat-based similarity to identify natural groupings of Pokemon using graph clustering techniques?*
